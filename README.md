`da` is a NES disassembler. The generated assembly has been verified against the assembly generated by [`nes-disasm`](https://github.com/amaiorano/nes-disasm) , using the collection of [`nes-test-roms`](https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms) as input. The disassembler should be able to handle both zipped and uncompressed iNes and NES 2.0 ROM files.
