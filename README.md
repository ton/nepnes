`da` is a NES disassembler, tested against a collection of [`nes-test-roms`](https://github.com/christopherpow/nes-test-roms). The generated assembly has been verified against the assembly generated by [`nes-disasm`](https://github.com/amaiorano/nes-disasm). The disassembler should be able to handle both zipped and uncompressed iNes and NES 2.0 ROM files, although the collection of ROMS tested so far is rather small.
